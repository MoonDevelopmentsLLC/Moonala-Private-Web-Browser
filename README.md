## üöÄ Briefing

- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-Driven Development**
  
  Zero telemetry. No profiling. All local. Every request scrutinized, every connection transparent.

- üß† **Built for Deep Research**  

  Tab grouping, multi-window workflows, AI and LLM convienience implemented, eye protection, the list
      goes on ‚Äî reimagining what browsers should do for thinkers. Bringing pc features to mobile as a side quest. 

- ‚ú® **Minimal UI, Maximal Clarity**  

  Focus-oriented ui with immersive layouts and plenty of tools. Great anywhere, excellent on the go.

- üß≠ **Ethical Codebase**  

  Source-available, human-readable, and built without surveillance. Code with a conscience. No nonsense. 
      0 Data Abuse.

- üí∞**What about financials?** 

  There is no finances right now, I fund and dedicate my time to the project, ideally in the future the funds
      will come from sponsors who are ethical, donations, grants, merch, enterprise licensing and partnerships with
      ethical funding foundations. Fundamentals can't be changed or swayed and personal data is never shared. If a future
      financial supporter wishes to advertise through Moonala in any way, they will be screened and expected to meet the standards of the global privacy iniative whilst respecting user right's as well.

- **What do you stand to gain and how do I know you are not selling my data secretly?**

  Valid question. Yea, I absolutely want to make money doing this. A motive to gain enough to fund the best privacy suite there is while putting a smile on my family's face every single day and taking care of them. I wholeheartedly believe this can be done with integrity and standing by the core values of the project. What I stand to gain is starting something that may become more, something that is giving value to the community, something worth earning back a value that can bring my family into stability. I don't think my motives stray too far from the average dream. I have always missed the days of buying tech and owning it fully. I loved modding my psp growing up, I loved jailbreaking an iPhone for the first time, I especially have fond memories of taking apart my pc and putting it back together in my more-naive-than-now days expecting it to somehow get faster from a sketchy cleaning that ended up bricking it. I did end up bringing it back to life years later because I learned I was simply shorting the board with metal on metal contact. Learning the intricacies of tech has always excited me. Although I didn't have much money growing up to go out and experience it all, free software helped me get every last drop of enjoyment out of my tech. Especially as a kid and even now. I love all of the free software I use that adds to my quality of life, software I would otherwise be unable to use if it costed $$$. All of the prebuilt custom firmwares, private servers for games, down to the amazing virtual machines I used to farm in, and now as an adult, work in. I just want to provide something good. I want to earn, not extract. The source is available, You can also test for yourself by wiresharking it, pi-holing, dns logging, etc. There is a guide available here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark. I will move away from webkit/webview on the android version if it ever comes a day that telemetry cannot be disabled in it. Finally, for those who don't care for the backstory and just want the legal jargon, I have no interest in your data and I make the legal claim that there is no data transmitted too me in my privacy policy on moonala.com.

- üß© **Tech Stack**

        Java, Kotlin, and the typical basics. Keeping it simple and approachable.

        Q: Other webview based browsers are missing web features like OAuth2
           and do things like sending the app package in the header. What
           makes Moonala any different? How can I daily drive it with these
           web features broken and lack of default privacy? 

        A: Moonala has been coded to include full functionality despite
           webview normally blocking or not supporting certain functions. 
           99% of the time everything will work. When it doesn't, the unchained
           tabs(compatibility mode) are designed to work 100% of the time even 
           with sites that get overzealous with their tracking requirements.  
           The defaults are set to a relaxed private that is still very private if used right.
           Also, when set to max privacy with the switch or using the hardening guide in settings
           identifying data is destroyed to levels not seen elsewhere. Almost all webview browsers 
           that I have tested have some essence of privacy in their claim and despite this,
           nearly all of them announce you are using "your exact device, with that browser, via that app."
           With absolutely no way to prevent it from happening. When they DO support privacy, they lack 
           elsewhere, be it web features, full usability, or modernity through the browser.
           WebKit was also chosen because I have recently stopped using the gecko engine due to errors
           that do not happen when using WebKit, some of these errors cause a complete block to my workflow.
           This sentiment is reflected online and often times hosting services will have additional docs just for
           errors that crop up using the gecko engine, such as pr end of file errors that are handled gracefully 
           in WebKit. Since Moonala is meant to be daily driven, it makes sense to use a high compatibility web engine.
  

           Moonala is not trying to be like the rest of the webview browsers. Its not the next 
           fox clone or mainstream browser re-skin. It is Moonala. It is trying to be different.

           There is an entire *Custom Extensions & Plugins engine in development*
           meant to rival the big players while being easier to use and universally compatible.
