## 🚀 Briefing

- 🛡️ **Privacy-Driven Development**
  
  Zero telemetry. No profiling. All local. Every request scrutinized, every connection transparent.

- 🧠 **Built for Productive Deep Research**  

  Tab grouping, multi-window workflows, AI and LLM convienience implemented, eye protection, the list
      goes on — reimagining what browsers should do. Bringing pc features to mobile as a side quest. 

- ✨ **Minimal UI, Maximal Clarity**  

  Focus-oriented UI with immersive layouts and plenty of tools. Great anywhere, excellent on the go.

- 🧭 **Ethical Codebase**  

  Source-available, Code with a conscience. No nonsense. 0 Data Abuse.

- 💰**What about financials?** 

  There is no finances right now, I currently take a loss on developing the project but I will be looking for funding soon. Ideally in the future the funds
      will come from sponsors who are ethical, donations, grants, merch, enterprise licensing and partnerships with
      ethical funding foundations. Fundamentals can't be changed or swayed and personal data is never shared. If a future
      financial supporter wishes to advertise through Moonala in any way, they will be screened and expected to meet the standards of the global privacy iniative whilst respecting user right's as well.

- 🧩 **Tech Stack**

        Java, Kotlin, and the typical basics. Keeping it simple and approachable.

        Q: Other webview based browsers are missing web features like OAuth2
           and do things like sending the app package in the header. What
           makes Moonala any different? How can I daily drive it with these
           web features broken and lack of default privacy? 

        A: Moonala has been coded to include full functionality despite
           webview normally blocking or not supporting certain functions. 
           99% of the time everything will work. When it doesn't, the unchained
           tabs(compatibility mode) are designed to work 100% of the time even 
           with sites that get overzealous with their tracking requirements.  
           The defaults are set to a relaxed private that is still very private if
           used right. When set to max privacy with the force field switch or using
           the hardening guide in settings identifying data is removed to levels
           not seen in other webview based browsers, including package headers and device info.
           The webview browsers that I have tested specify they are built to be private and despite
           this, in my tests all of them announce you are using "your exact device, with that browser, 
           via that app." With no instructions on hardening via dev tools or alternative solutions
           offered. When they do support privacy, they lack elsewhere, be it web features, full usability,
           or modernity in the browser itself. WebKit was also chosen because the gecko engine produces
           some errors not seen in webkit. This sentiment is reflected online and often times hosting
           services will have additional docs just for errors that crop up using the gecko engine, such
           as pr end of file errors that are handled gracefully in WebKit. Since Moonala is meant to be
           daily driven, it makes sense to use a high compatibility web engine. Bundling webkit is currently -WIP-
           The current testing releases using webview will be maintained, so have no worries about getting
           use to a certain flavor and it depracating. As a bonus, the webview edition **should** be compatible
           with privacy centric webviews like bromite, allowing for a dual layer of protection.

           **If you don't login to personally identifying sites and you use a clean IP not linked to you,
           Moonala is very private and probably stable too. A lot of the current issues are linked to sites
           that don't like Moonala's paranoid by default anti-tracking, usually sites requiring a login
           that is tied to an identity.**

           Moonala is not trying to be like the rest of the webview browsers. Its not the next 
           fox clone or mainstream browser re-skin. It is Moonala. 

           There is a *Custom Extensions & Plugins engine in development*
           meant to rival the big players while being easier to use and universally compatible.

🙌 Contributing

Moonala aims to thrive on community. Bug fixes, feature ideas, docs updates, etc — all welcome.
Start by checking issues or join discussions. No issue is unworthy of sharing, theres no shame in mistakes here.
All of the current testing and use of the app has been done on **ONE** device. Please **DO NOT** hesitate to open issues.
I would also like to plead for your patience, I currently work on the entire project alone, from coding, website building, to setting
up the readme on github, everything. Things may seem slow at times but I will take care of issues. In order of severity.

When contributing code, try to meet these ideals : 
Designed for dreamers. Built for researchers. Protected for everyone. Safe for the family.

- **What do you stand to gain and how do I know you are not selling my data secretly?**

  Valid question. Yea, I absolutely want to make money doing this. I hope to provide the best privacy suite available, while putting a smile on my family's face every single day and taking care of them. I wholeheartedly believe this can be done with integrity and standing by the core values of the project. What I stand to gain is starting something that may become more, something that is giving value to the community, something worth earning back a value that can bring my family into stability. I don't think my motives stray too far from the average dream. In retrospect, I have always missed the days of buying tech and owning it fully. I loved modding my psp growing up, I loved jailbreaking an iPhone for the first time, I especially have fond memories of taking apart my pc in my more-naive-than-now days expecting it to somehow get faster from a sketchy cleaning that ended up "bricking" it. I did bring it back to life years later, learning I was simply shorting the board with metal on metal contact. Learning the intricacies of tech has always excited me. Although I didn't have much money growing up to get the latest and experience it all, free software helped me get every last drop of enjoyment out what I did have. Especially as a kid and even now. I love all of the free software I use that adds to my quality of life, software I would otherwise be unable to use if it costed $$$. All of the prebuilt custom firmwares, private servers for games, the whole OSS scene, down to the amazing virtual machines I used to farm in, and now as an adult, work in. I just want to provide something good. I want to earn, not extract. Even though its not fully open yet, the source is available. You can also test for yourself by wiresharking it, pi-holing, dns logging, etc. There is a guide available here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark. I will move away from webkit/webview on the android version if it ever comes a day that telemetry cannot be disabled in it. 

Finally, for those who don't care for the backstory and just want the legal jargon, I have no interest in your data and I make the legally liable claim that there is no data transmitted too me in my privacy policy on moonala.com.
