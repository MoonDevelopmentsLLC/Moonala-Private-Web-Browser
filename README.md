- üí∞**What about financials?** 

    There is no finances right now, I fund and dedicate my time to the project, in the future the funds will come from sponsors who are ethical, donations, grants, merch, enterprise licensing and partnerships with ethical funding foundations. Fundamentals can't be changed or swayed and personal data is never shared. 

- **What do you stand to gain and how do I know you are not selling my data secretly?**

    Yea, I absolutely want to make money doing this. Enough to fund the best privacy suite there is while putting a smile on my family's face every single day and taking care of them. I wholeheartedly believe this can be done with integrity and standing by the roots of the project. What I stand to gain is starting something that may become more. The source is available, You can also test for yourself by wiresharking it, pi-holing, dns logging, etc. There is a guide available here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark I have no interest in your data and I make the legal claim that there is no data transmitted too me in my privacy policy on moonala.com.
