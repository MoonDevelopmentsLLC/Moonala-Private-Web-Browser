## üåô  Your attention, your choices. Moonala respects that.

<details><summary>- üß† Productive Research, Daily Browsing, and more. Its Your Choice.   </summary> <br>
     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Tab grouping, multi-window workflows, AI convienience, eye protection, **guards for WebGl and Canvas use**, the list
      goes on ‚Äî reimagining what browsers should do. While also bringing pc features to mobile as a side quest.</summary></details>

 <details><summary>- üõ°Ô∏è Feature Rich, Privacy-Driven Development.   </summary> <br>
         &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Zero telemetry. No profiling. All local. Every request scrutinized, every connection transparent. Does ____ webpage have an annoyance on-screen? No worries, Moonala can remove that for you.
    With a **native** element remover, you can get those time consuming annoyances off the screen with just a tap, and in the future, it will also store references to past removed annoyances and keep them removed globally on **any** page. </details>

<details><summary>- üß≠ Ethical Code. Permissions are optional.    </summary> <br>
           &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Source-available, Code with a conscience. No nonsense. Privacy is the muse. No Data Abuse.</details>

<details><summary>- ‚ú® Minimal UI, Maximal Focus.    </summary> <br>
          &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Focus-oriented UI with immersive mode, different layouts and plenty of tools. Great anywhere, especially excellent on the go. </details>


<details><summary>- üí∞ What about financials? </summary> <br>
             &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  No matter the financial situation, fundamentals can't be changed or swayed and personal data is never shared or transmitted to Moon Developments.</details>


<details><summary>- üß© Language + Basic Q&A
  </summary>
              Java, Kotlin, and the typical basics. Keeping it simple and approachable.<br><br>
            
  **If you don't login to personally identifying sites and you use a clean IP not linked to you,
           Moonala is very private and probably stable too. A lot of the current issues are linked to sites
           that don't like Moonala's paranoid by default anti-tracking, usually sites requiring a login
           that is tied to an identity. Moonala is so paranoid that it will mess with websites that try to
           access your battery information, giving them fake information.**
 
   Moonala is not trying to be like the rest of the browsers. Its not the next 
           fox clone or mainstream browser re-skin. It is Moonala.


  Q: Other browsers using webview are missing critical features like OAuth
           and do things like sending the app package in the header. Does Moonala intend to include full functionality?

  A: OAuth works (tested on feedly.com), Moonala has full functionality and aims to maintain it,
           despite websites and google not supporting certain functions through a 'webview'.
           98.9% of the time everything will work. When needed, the unchained
           tabs(compatibility mode) are designed to work 100% of the time. <br>Useful 
           for sites that get overzealous with their tracking requirements. -See Bold Text-<br><br> 
           The defaults are set to a relaxed private that is still very private if
           used right. If your version of webview is outdated the package may be shown 
           but you can follow the security guide in settings or **use the lunar force field** to remove that.
           When all nazar switches are toggled on (pressing strict privacy in setup)
           identifying data is removed to an extent not seen in most browsers without 
           heavy tinkering, addons installed, or not at all. WebView is very much a version of WebKit, one case 
           for its use is because the gecko engine produces some errors not seen in webkit.
           This sentiment is reflected online and often times hosting services will have 
           additional docs just for errors that crop up using the gecko engine, such
           as pr end of file errors that are handled gracefully in WebKit. Since Moonala
           is meant to be usable as a default browser, it is logical to use a high compatibility
           web engine. Bundling a custom webkit is currently -MWIP-. The current testing releases 
           using webview will be maintained. As a bonus, the webview edition theorhetically should
           be compatible with privacy centric webviews like bromite, allowing for a dual layer of protection. **I have not tested this myself, testing is on AOSP's WebView.**.
          As of 2025, Moonala passes browserleaks.com's content filters and proxy detection, remaining undetected even when using adguard, canvas protection, and header cleaners.
           
   Q: What do you have implemented for those of us who want to do more with the browser without having to work with the source?<br>
          A: There is a *Custom Extensions & Plugins engine in development*
           hopefully all in javascript, meant to be easy to use and universally compatible.

   Q: What if google pulls the plug on webview?<br>
          A: The Codebase is designed to be modular, a replacement engine is possible in the future, at **any** time. For now, WebView is suitable for the project and if google stops supporting it, the project will respond accordingly. Although it is unlikely, as it is an integral part of the android system. This is actually a dual edged sword or whatever the phrase is, because google's security updates to webview benefit Moonala, despite the con of having a dependency attached to google.   

   Q: What are your relations to Pale Moon? what is the word Moonala ?<br>
          A: No relation. The theme around the moon stems from the enjoyment of looking at the moon while it rains and drifting into the peaceful night. Pale Moon is a cool project, I can respect what they are doing for sure. Nala for me has meant, Never Angry, Always Loving. Lunala is a cool pokemon too.

üì¶ Getting Started

<details><summary> Download the apk from releases, install it, and you're ready to launch!<br>
                   <br> Prefer Google Play? Head here -> https://moonala.com/google-play-alpha-sign-up

  </summary>

  <br><br> A popup will display on the very first run with optional setups, it can be recalled by tapping Lunar Features in the menu.
    Due to way the code is currently set up, If you are not on android 9+ the testing releases will probably be unstable. I currently do testing on an android 14 device and occasionally when the chance arises an android 9 device. Once I am able to test more android versions, I will address stability issues on them. For now, I can say android 9+ SHOULD be completely crash free, but I have not tested every website there is or anything, so there is still a chance. One more small quirk, the app is suppose to be fully optional on permissions, but on android 9 if you use downloads it will require storage permissions.</details>

üôå Contributing<br>
Bug fixes, feature ideas, docs, updates, etc ‚Äî all welcome.
Things may seem slow at times but in order of severity, issues **will** be taken care of. <br>

  <details><summary> Known Persistent Issues : </summary> <br> 1. Older Single Use Download Links fail, right now I only know of 1fichier 
           having this issue. <br> 2.Due to lack of indentifying information cloudflare verification loops with force field on.
           This does not include all known issues because some are already being worked on. </details> <br><br>

## Data Policy

- **What do you stand to gain and how do I know you are not selling my data secretly?**
<details><summary>Open Answer</summary> 
  Valid question. No, I am not selling your data. Œ£(ÔæüÂè£Ôæü;)// Unbelievable in this day and age, I know. To clarify motives, yea, I absolutely want to make money doing this. I hope to provide the best privacy suite available, while putting a smile on my family's face every single day and taking care of them. I wholeheartedly believe this can be done with integrity and standing by the core values of the project. What I stand to gain is starting something that may become more, something that is giving value to the community, and in the process earning back a value that helps me take care of my loved ones. I don't think my motives stray too far from the average dream. In retrospect, I have always missed the days of buying tech and owning it fully. I remember discovering limewire on my sister's pc and it blew my mind. Not only that, homebrew is amazing. I loved modding my psp growing up, I loved jailbreaking an iPhone for the first time. Taking apart my pc expecting it to somehow get faster from a sketchy cleaning that ended up "bricking" it devastated me. Bringing it back to life years later, was a eureka moment of happiness. Learning the intricacies of tech has always excited me. Although I didn't have much money growing up to get the latest and experience it all, tech was still my best friend. Free software helped me get every last drop of enjoyment out of what I did have, as a kid and even now. I love all of the free software I use that adds to my quality of life, software I would otherwise be unable to use if it costed $$$. All of the prebuilt custom firmwares, private servers for games, the whole OSS scene, down to the amazing virtual machines I used to farm my mmos in, and now as an adult, they are an invaluable tool for work. I just want to provide something good. I want to earn, not extract. I believe in owning something you pay for, this meaning you can do whatever you want with it. Despite Moonala being free, you are paying with your attention by using it, helping the userbase grow. <br><br>

  You can test for yourself by wiresharking Moonala, pi-holing, dns logging, etc. I haven't done a packet capture yet but its in the plans when I get more devices. If you get a chance too before me, I would like to hear the results! There is a guide here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555403/capturing-mobile-phone-traffic-on-wireshark. I will move away from webkit/webview on the android version if it ever comes a day that telemetry cannot be disabled in it. I strongly disagree with undisclosed telemetry and tracking. I dislike it if left on by default, even when given the undisclosed option to turn it off. If its on by default, what was the point?! If its off by default and just a supportive option, I can be sane and understand the purpose. I know it can be impossible to understand the issue at times without some sort of log. The source is currently only being opened for certain parts of the browser, once funding and a foundation to keep development going for many years to come is established, the move to 100% open source will begin. </details>

Don't care for the backstory and just want the legal jargon? I have no interest in your data and I make the legally liable claim that there is no data transmitted too me in my privacy policy on moonala.com.
