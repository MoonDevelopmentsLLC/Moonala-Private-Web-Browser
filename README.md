## üöÄ Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy-Driven Development**  
  Zero telemetry. No profiling. All local. Every request scrutinized, every connection transparent.

- üß† **Built for Deep Research**  
  Tab grouping, multi-window workflows, distraction-free modes ‚Äî reimagining what browsers should do for thinkers. Bringing pc features to mobile as a side quest. 

- ‚ú® **Minimal UI, Maximal Clarity**  
  Focus-oriented ui with immersive layouts and plenty of tools. Great anywhere, excellent on the go.

- üåå **Digital Future Design Language**

- üß≠ **Ethical Codebase**  
  Source-available, human-readable, and built without corporate surveillance hooks. Code with a conscience. No nonsense. I don't care for user data. 0 Data Abuse.

- üí∞**What about financials?** 

    There is no finances right now, I dedicate my time at a cost, in the future the funds will come from sponsors who are ethical, donations, grants, merch, enterprise licensing and partnerships with privacy funding foundations. Fundamentals can't be changed or swayed and personal data is never shared. Yea, I definitely want to make money doing this. A whole lot of it. Enough to fund the best privacy suite there is and put a smile on my family's face every single day. 

- üß© Tech Stack

    Java, Kotlin, the typical basics, keeping it simple and approachable.
